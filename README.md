This repository is created to showcase code created to solve a third assignment for the course Stochastic Simulations at University of Amsterdam. The code is divided in two parts, in the first notebook "_Code_Gready.ipynb" is all the code related to Greedy Solution and tests on TSP heuristics, and the second notebook named "_Code_SA.ipynb" where we perform all the experiments for Simulated Annealing.

Now we should shed some light on what is the assignment. The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an NP-hard problem in mathematical optimization, in which we look for the shortest possible route connecting a set of cities.
While various strategies have been devised to address the TSP, in this assignment we explore two of them: simplest Greedy approach and Simulated Annealing (SA), which is inspired by the natural crystallization process in the real life.
We conducted our experiments on three distinct configurations containing 51, 280, and 442 cities on a 2D grid, predominantly focusing on the average-sized map. An in-depth analysis was carried out on the effects of different cooling schedules and the length of the Markov Chain on the quality of the obtained results.
Our findings suggest that a quadratic cooling function, combined with an initial temperature based on an average initial path size within a network with several million steps in the chain, optimally balances convergence speed and quality of the found solutions.
